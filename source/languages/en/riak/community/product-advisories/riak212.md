A packaging issue was identified in Riak KV 2.1.2 that we will resolve in a Riak KV 2.1.3 release within the next 48 hours. In the interim we have removed access to the Riak KV 2.1.2 release packages.

We recommend users wait for Riak KV 2.1.3 to deploy these latest improvements to the Riak KV 2.1 series into a production environment.
