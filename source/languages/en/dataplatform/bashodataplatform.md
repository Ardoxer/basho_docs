#Basho Data Platform

Basho Data Platform (BDP) builds on Riak KV (Riak) to support your data-centric services. Ensure your application is highly available and scalable by leveraging BDP features such as:

* Data replication & synchronization between components
* Real-time analytics through Apache Spark integration
* Cluster management
* Caching with Redis for rapid performance (Enterprise only)

BDP reduces the complexity of integrating and deploying the components of your technology stack, providing NoSQL databases, caching, real-time analytics, and search. These features are required in order to run distributed active workloads across applications, and BDP controls the replication and synchronization of data between components and while also providing cluster management.

>Some features of BDP are only available for Enterprise users. These will be marked as Enterprise-only.
