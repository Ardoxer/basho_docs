  <!-- Whole Lot'a Side-Navs
       ---------------------
    For every Menu (read: every project) build a full navigation side bar that
    defaults to `display:none`. After the page has fully loaded, we'll munge the
    URL to try to figure out which project we're on, and selectively reveal the
    correct menu.
       TODO:
       -----
    This is actually a really inconsiderate way of solving this problem. Text is
    cheap, but we're still shipping every possible side-nav that might ever show
    up on this site, and we're only _maybe_ revealing one of them. As the number
    of project versions climbs, so too will the amount of hidden text we ship
    on this page. I can see it getting pretty awful, pretty fast.
    We should look into a more permanent solution at some point.

       -----------------------------

       ---------
    This is.... so fragile. So very fragile. This is the most fragile thing, and
    that makes me really iffy about it.
    It's actually pretty hard for me to predict how this is going to break
    first, because there are so many way this could break. I really hope we'll
    be able to clean it up some day, some how...
