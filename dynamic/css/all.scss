// NOTE(Drew): Importing CSS into Sass/Compass is a bit weird, by which I mean
// it's not been implemented. We're currently using the beta sass-css-importer
// (https://github.com/chriseppstein/sass-css-importer) gem to modify (read:
// sidestep) the Compass/Sass import process. The end result being the format
// for imports below;
//   * A prepended CSS:
//   * No `.css` file extension
//   * No love from the `--import-path` directive, so a full path
// This somewhat calls into question the above process for including Scss files.
// Do we want to use the full path for them as well? It also begs the question
// 'why did we write any non-sass CSS?'
//FIXME(Drew): The above may be incorrect;
//   https://github.com/chriseppstein/sass-css-importer#more-complex-scenarios
//   `add_import_path Sass::CssImporter::Importer.new("/path/to/the/css/files")`
// This may require be a relatively small change to the Rakefile's
// `compile_scss` function.
